# How is MCO today?

An automated bot called [@howismcotoday](https://x.com/howismcotoday) on [X](x.com), which scrapes the MCO Departures Board for upcoming departures and produces a scoring metric for how well the airport is operating. Posts an updated score every hour.

A **good** hour is defined currently as 50% or more of scheduled departures are on-time.

A **bad** hour is defined currently as 50% or less of scheduled departures are on-time.

In the future, the bot will add functionality to pull TSA wait times and build a more robust scoring system. For now though, this is a little webscraper to twitter pipeline. :)
